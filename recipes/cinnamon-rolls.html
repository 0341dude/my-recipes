        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You don't have to run to the mall to satisfy your craving for cinnamon rolls — soft and warm from the oven and drizzled with icing. We'll show you step by step how to make cinnamon rolls from scratch — from making the dough to filling, forming, baking, and icing — with loads of helpful tips along the way.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Dough:</p>
            <li>1 Cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 Eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup margarine, melted</li>
            <li>4.5 cups bread fluor</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2.5 tsp bread machine yeast</li>
            <p>Filling:</p>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, softened</li>
            <p>Icing:</p>
            <li>1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start. </li>
            <li>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle. </li>
            <li>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.</li>
            <li>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. </li>
            <li>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.</li>
            <li>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.</li>
        </ol>
